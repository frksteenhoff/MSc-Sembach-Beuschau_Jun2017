## Data visualization 

All content in this repository is made for the Master Thesis of Jesper Bo Sembach and Niels Beuscahu, DTU 2017. This solution is specialized to extract relevant content from a file structure hidden from this repository. The solution is specialized and most of the work cannot be applied to other data without the need of heavy code-edits. 

### Contents
``Visualization`` - plots (box plots and graphs) of performance of different parameters (CPU, HDD, RAM..) and box plots to compare different measurements.

``DataExtractNManipulation.ipynb`` - the code generating the plots in the Visualization folder.

``ProofOfConcept.ipynb`` - some code snippets testing different pythonic methods.
